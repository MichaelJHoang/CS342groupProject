To Install on linux:

2. Type make
3. Type java GameTester

The code contains 7 classes, the place, artifact, game, direction, character, move and gametester classes. I also added a 
decision maker interface and a cleanlinescanner class. I finally got the program to read in the file so the game runs for 
file version 3.1 now. A sample 3.1 file is included with the submission. I had difficult time implementing the character and move
classes to how the professor wants them, I attempted to try to figure it out to no avail right now. I'm sure once I 
spend more time on it and once professor explains it, I will be able to figure it out. File 4.1 won't work on my code because I
haven't read in characters yet. For now, I made progress and got itto run 3.1 and almost 4.1 if I get characters to make 
moves accordingly. I commented a lot of my code so you can follow along, I tried to comment better, see for yourself.

Commands for the game are as follows:

1. "GO" All 18 Directions (Caps doesn't Matter)
2. All 18 directions (Caps dont matter)
3. Look, (looks around in room for artifacts)
4. Get, Use, Drop, (picks up, uses, drops artifacts)
5. Exit, Quit(Caps dont matter) Leaves Game
